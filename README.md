This is the official open-source repository of the University of Pittsburgh Sports Science department. We will update zero-cost datasets and coding resources periodically to increase access to data anlysis and visualization efforts across the field.

### Directory
The repository is structured by version, year and topic. 

#### Monthly
The `Monthly` folder contains all Pitt Sports Science Monthly's and relevant scripts to reproduce the figures from the manuscripts/PDFs.
