# Open-Source

### Basic information

This is the official `open-source repository` of the University of Pittsburgh Sports Science department, where we will upload our Pitt Sports Science Monthly, release ShinyApps and the correspoding scripts, or any other sports-science-related content. 

### Directory
The repository is structured by version, year and topic. 

#### Monthly
The `Monthly` folder contains all Pitt Sports Science Monthly's and relevant scripts to reproduce the figures from the manuscripts/PDFs. All data to reproduce the figures was extracted using `WebPlotDigitizer` by [ankitrohatgi](https://github.com/ankitrohatgi/WebPlotDigitizer)).
