# Open-Source

### Basic information

This is the official open-source repository of the University of Pittsburgh Sports Science department. We will update zero-cost datasets and coding resources periodically to increase access to data anlysis and visualization efforts across the field.

### Directory
The repository is structured by project. 

`Test-retest reliability`
The **test-retest reliability** folder contains relevant scripts to quantify intraclass correlation coefficients, coefficient of variation, standard error of measurements or minimum detectable change for relevant sports science outcomes. It also includes a **Shiny App** that allows users to compare the change in performance to the measurement error found in the literature or computed by us, in order to determine if the change is physiologically relevant or possibly due to natural variability in measurement.
